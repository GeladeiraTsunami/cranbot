# Cranbot
 A meme Discord bot made possible with [Discord.js](https://discordjs.guide) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). &nbsp;

 **Note: This is a private bot, you can't add it to your own server, this is more of a template project, I strongly recommend checking the official [Discord.js Documentation](https://discordjs.guide) for more information and code explanation.**

### How to create your own Cran-like bot:
* (NOT READY) This will be fixed upon release (1.0.0).
* Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* Create a folder
* Under the folder do `npm init`.
* Then `npm install discord.js`.
* Go to [Discord Developer](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). Log-in to your account and create a Application.
* Under settings go to BOTS, create your custom bot and COPY your token.
* On your main folder, create a file named `config.json`, and paste this: ```{
	"prefix": "(!) ", //Note: this is just a optional command to call your bot if you want to, you can delete this line if you want. 
	"token": 'YOUR DISCORD TOKEN HERE'
    }```

* to log-in to your bot, go to cmd, type `cd C:\USER\INDEX.JS LOCATION`, and then `node index.js`.
